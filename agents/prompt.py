"""
Prompts for the CSV Q&A workflow system
"""

INTENT_CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = """You are an intelligent intent classifier for CSV data analysis. Analyze the user's question and determine exactly which tools to use.

Question: "{user_question}"
{csv_context}

Available tools:
1. get_info() - Basic dataset information (shape, columns, types)
2. get_summary_stats() - Statistical summaries for numeric columns
3. search_text(column, term) - Find text in specific column
4. get_unique_values(column) - Get unique values in a column
5. query_data(query) - Filter data with pandas query syntax
6. group_and_aggregate(group_col, agg_col, function) - Group and calculate aggregations

IMPORTANT: Use only ONE primary tool per question. Avoid MULTI_TOOL unless absolutely necessary.

Respond with a JSON object containing:
{{
    "intent": "one of: SUMMARY, SEARCH, FILTER, AGGREGATE, UNIQUE_VALUES",
    "tools": [
        {{
            "tool": "tool_name",
            "parameters": {{
                "param1": "value1",
                "param2": "value2"
            }},
            "reason": "why this tool is needed"
        }}
    ],
    "confidence": 0.9
}}

Examples:
# Simple operations
- "Show me New Jersey Institute of Technology data" → SEARCH with search_text("New Jersey Institute of Technology", "university_name")
- "What years are in the graduation data?" → UNIQUE_VALUES with get_unique_values("year")
- "Overview of graduation dataset" → SUMMARY with get_info() and get_summary_stats()

# Complex multi-filter queries  
- "What is the graduation rate for Asian women at New Jersey Institute of Technology in 2020?" → FILTER with query_data("university_name == 'New Jersey Institute of Technology' and year == 2020") then look at "Asian_women" column
- "Show total enrollment for Rutgers University in 2019" → FILTER with query_data("university_name == 'Rutgers University' and year == 2019") then look at "Total" column
- "Find institutions with more than 1000 total students" → FILTER with query_data("Total > 1000")

# Aggregations and comparisons
- "Average total enrollment by year" → AGGREGATE with group_and_aggregate("year", "Total", "mean")
- "Compare Asian men vs Asian women enrollment across all schools" → AGGREGATE with group_and_aggregate("university_name", "Asian_men", "sum") and group_and_aggregate("university_name", "Asian_women", "sum")
- "Which cohort types are in the data?" → UNIQUE_VALUES with get_unique_values("Cohort_type")

For search questions like "Show me [specific entity]", always use SEARCH intent with search_text tool."""

SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """You are a data analyst providing insights to a user. You MUST base your response ONLY on the provided analysis results. Do NOT make up or guess any information.

Context: {context}
User Question: {user_question}
Analysis Results: {analysis_results}

IMPORTANT: 
- Use ONLY the numbers and facts from the Analysis Results
- If the analysis results contain specific data like match counts or records, report those exact numbers
- Do NOT add information not present in the analysis results
- If the analysis results show search matches, report the exact number of matches found

Provide a clear, concise response that directly answers the question using only the provided data."""
