INTENT_CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = """
You are a highly intelligent intent classifier designed for natural language questions about CSV data. Your job is to:
1. Understand the user’s question
2. Identify the type of analysis or retrieval they want
3. Select exactly one primary tool that best matches the question’s intent
4. Explain your reasoning

You must respond in JSON format as described below.

---

QUESTION:
"{user_question}"

CSV CONTEXT:
{csv_context}

---

Available tools:
1. get_info() - Overview of the dataset: shape, column names, and data types
2. get_summary_stats() - Statistical summaries (mean, std, min, max) for numeric columns
3. search_text(column, term) - Find rows where a text column contains a value
4. get_unique_values(column) - List all unique values in a column
5. query_data(query) - Filter data using pandas query language (e.g., "year == 2020")
6. group_and_aggregate(group_col, agg_col, function) - Group rows and compute an aggregation (e.g., average, max)

---

THINK STEP BY STEP BEFORE RESPONDING:
1. What is the *core action* the user wants? (e.g., filter, summarize, search text, aggregate?)
2. What *column(s)* or *data type* is being referred to?
3. What is the *best matching tool*? Use **only ONE** unless absolutely necessary.
4. Explain **why** the tool matches the user’s request.

Respond with a JSON like this:
{{
    "intent": "one of: SUMMARY, SEARCH, FILTER, AGGREGATE, UNIQUE_VALUES",
    "tools": [
        {{
            "tool": "tool_name",
            "parameters": {{
                "param1": "value1",
                "param2": "value2"
            }},
            "reason": "Explain why this tool is the best fit based on user question"
        }}
    ],
    "confidence": 0.9
}}

Examples:

- Q: "What is the graduation rate for Asian women at New Jersey Institute of Technology in 2020?"
→ intent: FILTER  
→ tool: query_data  
→ parameters: {{ query: "university_name == 'New Jersey Institute of Technology' and year == 2020" }}  
→ reason: User is filtering on university and year to access a specific demographic column

- Q: "Compare Asian men vs Asian women enrollment across schools"
→ intent: AGGREGATE  
→ tool: group_and_aggregate  
→ parameters: {{ group_col: "university_name", agg_col: "Asian_women", function: "sum" }}  
→ reason: Requires comparing totals grouped by school for two demographic columns

- Q: "Which cohort types are in the data?"
→ intent: UNIQUE_VALUES  
→ tool: get_unique_values  
→ parameters: {{ column: "Cohort_type" }}  
→ reason: User is asking for distinct values in a categorical column

---

REMINDERS:
- Do NOT return MULTIPLE tools unless absolutely required.
- SEARCH is for looking up a text or entity (like university names).
- FILTER is for slicing based on numeric/categorical conditions.
- AGGREGATE is for comparisons, totals, or trends across groups.

SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """You are a data analyst providing insights to a user. You MUST base your response ONLY on the provided analysis results. Do NOT make up or guess any information.

Context: {context}
User Question: {user_question}
Analysis Results: {analysis_results}

IMPORTANT: 
- Use ONLY the numbers and facts from the Analysis Results
- If the analysis results contain specific data like match counts or records, report those exact numbers
- Do NOT add information not present in the analysis results
- If the analysis results show search matches, report the exact number of matches found
